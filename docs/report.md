Each minimum spanning tree has exactly $$N-1$$ edges and achieves the minimum possible total cost for a connected, weighted, undirected graph, which is consistent with the MST definition and the assignmentâ€™s expectations.

### Prim vs Kruskal

- Kruskal sorts all edges by weight and adds them if they do not form a cycle, relying on a Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find) structure, which typically yields complexity $$O(M \log M)$$ and works naturally with edge-list inputs.
- Prim grows a single tree from an arbitrary start vertex using a priority queue over frontier edges, reaching $$O(M \log N)$$ with a binary heap and often performing well on dense graphs stored as adjacency structures.
- In practice, Kruskal is convenient for sparse graphs and when the input is already a list of edges, while Prim is convenient for dense graphs and adjacency-based storage with efficient decrease-key behavior.
- Both algorithms must return identical MST total cost on the same connected graph, although the selected edge sets may differ due to tie-breaking on equal weights, as required by the assignment.

### Conclusions

- Prefer Kruskal for sparse graphs and edge-list representations, as the global sort coupled with efficient Union-Find tends to be simple to implement and fast when $$M$$ is close to $$N$$.
- Prefer Prim for dense graphs and adjacency-list/matrix representations, where maintaining a frontier with a binary heap can be advantageous as $$M$$ approaches $$N^2$$.
- The measured operation counts increase monotonically across your five cases as graph size grows, which aligns with expectations from sorting more edges and performing more find/union operations in Kruskal.
